    <h1>Sami's Programming Journey</h1>

    <p>Hello, I'm Sami. My dad was a developer at Microsoft and sadly passed away in 2019 when I was 3 years old. Now, I am 9 years old, and I carry on his legacy as the second generation of developers in our family. Everything he knew, I now know, and I will show the world that I'm the best developer. This is the website I created using VS Code, and I aim to make my life easier through programming because programming equals money.</p>

    <p>At this age, I am a professional HTML developer with 3 years of experience. I learned programming through YouTube in Arabic, particularly on the Barmaja Online channel, which taught me the basics of programming. Later, I followed Othman NL's HTML playlist. I learned HTML in my house in Bousnika, Morocco, and I worked hard to keep it a secret until one day, my mom found out. She saw everything I was learning and entered me into a programming team in Morocco. Now, I have built my life with everything I want, and here's what I did to learn programming:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Buy a new book to write every lesson from this channel</li>
        <li>Learn Arabic to understand the content of this channel</li>
        <li>Once you learn Arabic, search for Othman NL's programming channel on YouTube and follow his lessons</li>
    </ul>
